        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
               Step 1. Proof the yeast. <br>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.
               After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.
            </li>
            <li>Step 2. Make and knead the pizza dough. <br> Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.
                Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Step 3. Let the dough rise. <br>
                Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil. Cover the dough with plastic wrap. For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Step 4. Prep the dough. <br> Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half.
                Form 2 round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours).</li>
            <li>Step 5. Shape the dough. <br>Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface.
                Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further.
                Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter—10 to 12 inches.</li>    
            <li>Step 5. Brush the dough with olive oil.</li>    
            <li>Step 6. Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings.</li>   
            <li>Step 7. Bake pizza in the 240°C oven, one at a time, until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10 to 15 minutes. If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.</li>     
        </ul>
